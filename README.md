# Secure Cloud Infrastructure with High Availability and Security

## Overview

This project demonstrates the design and deployment of a highly available, secure, and scalable cloud infrastructure on AWS. The architecture follows industry best practices for security and availability, integrating multi-tier architecture with advanced security controls.

## Objectives

**The project focuses on the following security and availability goals:**

  - Network Segmentation: Separation of public and private subnets to protect sensitive data.
  - Multi-layered Security: Implementation of security groups and network ACLs for traffic control.
  - Access Control: Restricting access to resources via a bastion host.
  - Data Encryption: Ensuring secure data transmission and storage using SSL/TLS.
  - Monitoring: Utilizing AWS CloudWatch for activity monitoring and logging.

## High Availability

  - Auto Scaling & Load Balancing: Ensures fault tolerance and consistent availability of services.
  - Multi-AZ RDS Deployment: Provides database redundancy and automatic failover in case of failures.

## Security Aspects

  - VPC Isolation: Protects resources from direct exposure to the Internet.
  - Bastion Host: Limits SSH access to authorized users.
  - Encryption: Implements data encryption in transit (SSL/TLS) and at rest.

## Architecture Diagram

  - The following architecture has been deployed:

## Technology Stack

  - Cloud Platform: AWS
  - Security Tools: AWS Security Groups, NACLs, SSL/TLS
  - Monitoring Tools: AWS CloudWatch
  - Database: Amazon RDS (Multi-AZ Deployment)

## Steps to Deploy

   - Set up a VPC with public and private subnets.
   - Configure Internet Gateway and NAT Gateway for routing traffic.
   - Deploy instances in the web, application, and database tiers using Auto Scaling Groups.
   - Secure access with Bastion Host and appropriate Security Groups.
   - Configure a Multi-AZ RDS instance for the database tier.
   - Enable monitoring using CloudWatch for logs and metrics.

## Security Implementations

   - Network Segmentation:
        - Separate public and private subnets to isolate the application layers.
   - Access Control:
        - Bastion Host for SSH access to private instances.
        - Security Groups and Network ACLs to manage inbound/outbound traffic.

   - Data Protection:
        - SSL/TLS encryption for data in transit.
        - RDS encryption for data at rest.
